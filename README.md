# ClassyPoker

## Introduction

Classy Poker is a Python based implementation of the game Texas Hold 'em.

When the program is run, the game will start and prompt the number of players.

After this, the hands are dealt, and the game asks if there will be a flop (that is, will the game continue, or have all but one person folded). By entering either Yes, yes, Y, or y, the game will continue. The same will occur for the turn, river, and showdown.
- Note, the ability to fold and place bets has not yet been implemented

At showdown, the game will score the players hands and determine the best 5 card hand that can be made out of the player's two cards and the five community cards. It will then announce the winner.

## Known Issues

The program does not handle a tie.
